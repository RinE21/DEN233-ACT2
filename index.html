          <h2>Social Justice</h2>
          <p>Social justice is about ensuring equal opportunities and access to resources for all. It's crucial for a fair and just society, where everyone can reach their full potential. However, in the Philippines, social justice remains a pressing issue, making it a risky profession for journalists and undermining their right to freedom of speech. Consequences of unachieved social justice include violence, crime, and social unrest, leading to a loss of trust in the government. Individuals can take action by organizing rallies and issuing statements to hold government officials accountable.</p>

                <h2>Human Rights</h2>
                <p>The UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) where it is a foundational document adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948 to establish human rights as universal.  Human rights are about the entitlement and freedom that belong to every person in the world regardless of their nationality, belief, and social status. These rights include the right to life, liberty, and security of person, freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, and the right to social security. Human rights protect individuals from discrimination and ensure the freedom to make their own decisions.</p>

                  <h2>Social Justice & Human Rights</h2>
                  <p>Social justice and human rights are closely linked because social justice aims to create an equal society where everyone can thrive, while human rights protect basic freedoms. They intersect in many ways, such as the case of Filipino journalists who were advocating and rallied for justice after a colleague's death and was helped by Human Rights to protect the rights of Filipino Journalists who did nothing but to let the public inform what they must know. In conclusion, both work towards a more just, equitable, and peaceful world.</p>
